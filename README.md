Yo so a few things:

You may already know about this stuff but if not this is just a nice to have either way.
if you check in the html file, you will see that on line 5 I have a <link> tag. This is used
to tell the html "yo theres some cool information in main.css", and will, for lack of better words,
'link' the css to the html, so that you can alter colors, margins, styles, etc. within the html.

You can connect multiple css files to html, however it doesn't go the other way around. for now stick to just one html file.

To see your changes in action, clone (download) the repository to your desktop, and just double click on the index.html file within this folder and it will bring you to one of your
browsers. Make a change, save it, and refresh the page on your browser, and you'll see it change really quick.

Now a note about JavaScript:
You now know that:
1. HTML acts as the skeleton for a web page, and holds the basic structure
2. CSS acts as a hippie painter and makes things look nice and colorful, arranged, Martha Stewart-ed
3. JavaScript...?

JavaScript is a functional programming language, as compared to Java, which is OOP. Functional as in it will react to 
events and triggers which happen on, say a web page (clicks, typing, etc). Use the w3school examples to help you understand it. Just type in
'Javascript w3schools' into google and go crazy.

I've also attached a main.js file to the html, which you can see already in the HTML file. this is where you're stuff with Firebase (ideally if 
you're still going this route) will go. There's no shame right now in copying & pasting code from online (don't do it in college, they will 
find you and penalize you) but try to understand it at least. I won't tell you how I linked the js file but...you should be able to figure that out.
Again with JS files you can link multiple js to an html file. However you can also link multiple HTML files to a single js, but you need to make sure the path and location you specify are correct; I don't need to add any /Desktop/thing/thing/thing/main.js because the main.js is in the same 'Directory' as the index.html. That's an important concept.

These are the main files you will ever really deal with, just an HTML, CSS, and JS file. However you'll also run into things which I have linked below:

JQuery - a Javascript library which makes writing functions and things easier in javascript
https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/
https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_get_started.asp (to add Jquery into your project)

https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp (basic html)

Git & Git Bash (So you can be like a real #coder) https://git-for-windows.github.io <-- download this

https://github.com/aychan/TabOpener <-- This should be a working example of firebase. clone this onto your desktop and open up the index.html and give it a try.

(you can google css w3school)

*NOTE: sometimes it is difficult to figure out what you need because starting out you don't know how to really ask a question or google something. Just let me know if you have trouble with that and i can help out.
